# Spaceships_battle
A competitive multiplayer two-player game that pits you against an opponent. As you maneuver through a treacherous asteroid field, be ready to dodge and weave through an onslaught of meteors that threaten your survival.

With audio effects, Master the controls using the WASD keys for navigation, and take aim with precision by pressing the left mouse button to unleash powerful laser blasts.

Engage in this interstellar showdown where quick reflexes and sharpshooting are your keys to victory. Will you emerge as the supreme cosmic champion, or will the relentless meteor flood claim your spacecraft? Charge your lasers, and may the best shooter prevail.
